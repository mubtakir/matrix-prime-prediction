def predict_next_prime(current: int, max_search: Optional[int] = None) -> int:
    """
    Predict the next prime number after current.
    
    Args:
        current: The current prime number
        max_search: Maximum search limit (optional)
        
    Returns:
        The next prime number
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If no prime found within search limit
    """
    pass

# Include comprehensive docstrings
